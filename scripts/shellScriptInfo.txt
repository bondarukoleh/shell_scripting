Script
Command line programm that contains a series of commands.
Shell access the interpreter and executes commands in script one by another.
Script either in PATH variable (you can execute it from everywhere) or you can execute in with "./path_to_script/scr.sh"

# (sharp) ! (bang) (shebang) /usr/bin/env bash (path to interpreter for commands listened in file, depends on OS)
There a few interpreters /bin/csh, ksh, zsh.

If you do not adding shebang - that script will be executed by default shell in OS, witch can cost problems,
maybe your shell by default is ok, but you don't know nothing about other guys.
